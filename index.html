        <h2>A little about myself</h2>
        <p>Excited and eager to break into the expanding and awesome field of technology! While there are so many options to choose from in the world of tech I found web development really interesting. I have chosen to challenge myself to learn an entirely new skill set so I can develop as a professional and enter this career field! .</p>
        <p>You could say that I’ve been around the block as I have worked in, retail, food services, logistics, transportation, security and, medical. Part of this was in service to the US of A and others were different jobs held after!  Now I have my sights set on adding Web Development as another notch to my belt of life experiences! .</p>
